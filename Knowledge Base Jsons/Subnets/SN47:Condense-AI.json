      "description": "Subnet as an Accelerate Adapter for LLM Inference. Seamless Integration: Effortlessly integrates with LLM inference engines, such as transformers, vllm. Token Compression: The subnet API compresses long sequences of natural language tokens into soft tokens. Decentralized Network: The subnet is a decentralized network that allows miners to contribute to the compression process. Tiered System: The subnet has a tiered system, with a research tier for experimentation and an inference tier for production-scale use. Incentive distribution is split for each tier. Benchmarking and Validation: The subnet owner defines synthetic metrics to benchmark minersâ€™ performance, ensuring quality and efficiency.",
