      "description": "Graphite is a specialized subnet designed to handle graphical problems efficiently. Graphite focuses on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic optimization problem that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting point. This problem is a fundamental challenge in the fields of computer science, mathematics, and operations research as its complexity grows exponentially with the number of cities.",
